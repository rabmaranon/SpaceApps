# Astro Walker 
#### Let's all experience walking in space!

A modification of Flappy Bird, built using [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/), with additional comments and customized graphics. Built in one day!



## Inspiration
This project lessens some problems faced when you're in isolation because it is very interactive. This is a modified version of the famous Flappy Bird game but is space themed. You can play as much as 6 players if you have good internet together and be competitive as much as you can. And there is also an offline version and you can also play with 2 players using Bluetooth if internet is not good in your area. Future development will have different levels with different planets as grounds and will incorporate a "Did you know?" section after every Game Over to be more informative. All of the fun facts will be from NASA's database so it's all going to be accurate. Also there will be an option to create your own character, be an astronaut yourself. Who doesn't want to be an astronaut, right? It's everybody's childhood dream! We're also considering to develop this into a full blown app game to all lovers of space. This is a fairly simple game but with great impact. 

This is my team's first ever game - we have a little  experience in CS so we want to challenge ourselves to make a game. This is the basic version of the game. Future developments will be added in the future.

## Installation
1. Install Python 3.7.x if necessary (instuctions [here](https://realpython.com/installing-python))

    `$ python --version  # check version number if you're not sure`

2. Install PyGame

    `$ python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user`

## Usage
#### To run the game:
    $ python AstroWalker.py

#### To play the game:
1. Press <kbd>Space</kbd> to start the game and to move the dog up or down.
2. The objective is to keep the dog 'flying' and squeeze between the obstacles. Once the dog collides with an obstacle, he will fall, signaling the end of a game. Press any <kbd>key</kbd> to start a new round.
3. The game can be exited at any time by pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd>.
